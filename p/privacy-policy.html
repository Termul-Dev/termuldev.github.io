    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 19 Sep 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how TermulDev ("we", "our", or "us")
      handles your information when you use our application ("App").
    </p>

    <h2>1. Permissions We Request</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:</strong> used to read files on your device 
        (e.g., loading images, documents, or other media as required by the App).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:</strong> used to save files or data 
        generated by the App directly to your device.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These permissions are used only for the core functionality of the App.
      We do not collect, upload, or share your personal files.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Aside from the above permissions, we do not collect personal data such as
      your name, email, or contact details, unless you provide them voluntarily.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To enable the Appâ€™s main features (reading and saving files).</li>
      <li>To ensure the App runs smoothly and securely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell or rent your personal data. We do not share your files with
      third parties. Data stays on your device unless you choose to share it
      yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      All files remain stored locally on your device. The App does not transfer
      your files to our servers. While we strive to protect your data, please
      note that no method of storage is completely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not
      knowingly collect data from children.

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      published on this page with an updated date.
